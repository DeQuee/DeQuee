Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am good at C and VHDL. I am less decent at version control software and websites, so I am here to learn that.
I am also here to learn how different kinds of C and VHDL code can look, to improve. 

I am currently working on a project involving Bluetooth Low Energy sensor control and E-paper displays.
